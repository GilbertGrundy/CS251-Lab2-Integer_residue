Program is a simple one file program which calculates the residue of
numbers in the form of: a^k mod n.

Given these values by the command line, the program prints a sequence
of values corresponding to: a^(2^k) mod n.

The program stops once it has the required values to do the calculation.

The program also highlights which values are required for the calculation.

The program can be re-run as many times as the user likes.
